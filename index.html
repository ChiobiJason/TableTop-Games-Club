          <p>
            The “Tabletop Games Club” strives to connect students through
            various tabletop games, from Dungeons and Dragons to chess. If you
            are interested in board games, card games, or even just want a place
            to hang out, this club is for you.

          <p>
            Our club intends to be an open space for students to let off steam
            while still being able to focus on schoolwork without the stressful
            commitment or responsibilities that other clubs may have. We employ
            a broad topic so that many interests can be served to some degree,
            ensuring that diversity is encouraged, and our focus on social
            interaction between students can be preserved.
